# Managing-a-TEE
 by David Berger and Eyal Sekbach

### What we learned from this project:
Our project manages communication (using a Socket) btw a Server, Host, and a secure Applet (Intel's DAL) stored on a PC. To protect access to our Applet, we used Rsa's Hash Algorithms (Public and Private keys) and HMAC based One-time-Passwords (learned in a theoretical course in CyberSecurity). We learned how to effectively manage communication in byte arrays, and store memory in bytes on Intel's Flash Storage.
